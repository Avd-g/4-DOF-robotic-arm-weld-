# 4-DOF-robotic-arm-weld-
This repository showcases a compact 4-DOF robotic arm CAD model designed in SolidWorks, ideal for precision-based industrial applications like welding, engraving, or small part manipulation. The arm features a tool head instead of a traditional gripper, adding versatility for task-specific end effectors.

ðŸ§© Key Features:
4 Degrees of Freedom: Enables a wide range of articulated movements for flexible task execution.

Integrated Tool Head: Includes a fixed tool mount (e.g., for welding, screwing, or marking applications).

Compact Design: Suitable for desktop-scale or confined workspace operations.

Motor Housing and Base Plate: Includes mounting bolts and servo housing for realistic implementation.

ðŸš€ Applications:
Desktop manufacturing

Educational robotics projects

Simulation of automated precision operations
